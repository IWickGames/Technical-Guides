# Passwords

Created 26.8 by Heli

**Use strong passwords**

* At least 12 characters long, preferably over 16
* Combination of upper case & lower case letters, numbers and special symbols
* Not re-used on other accounts
* Passwords **shouldn't** contain any personal info, as that may help attackers
* No common or repeating patterns

---

**To help remember and generate strong passwords, you should use a password manager**

* I recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
  * Open source, audited, easy to use, free
* **Make sure your master password is very strong**
  * At least 16 characters and apply the other rules from above
