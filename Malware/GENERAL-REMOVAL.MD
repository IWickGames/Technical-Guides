# General Malware Removal
Created by SkySRN converted by IWick

### What is malware
Malware is software that has the intent to do damage or to invoke malicious activity such as to encrypt your files and hold them for ransom to stealing your passwords. Malware is the blanket term for this and has a bunch of subcategories to more specifically sort malware into what effects it will do such as, ransomware, adware, or info stealers.

### How do I know if I have malware?
Depending on the type of malware you got it may be difficult to almost impossible to determine if you are infected in the first place such as info stealers or crypto miners are built to be as hidden as possible. The best thing you can do is run a scan with a tool to determine if your computer is infected or to do some manual digging by looking at processes, active network connections, etc. However, some malware is more obvious such as adware or ransomware, ransomware encrypts all your files and usually make lots of popups and read me files to tell you to pay and adware that usually injects ads into your web activity which can usually be more obvious but sometimes can be done by replacing already existing ads, so it depends.

## Removal and Recovery
Now to the removal part, this is the most important part and should be the first step as the longer you have the malware installed the more damage it could be doing. So here it goes.

### Step 1: Run an anti-malware scan
The first thing to do is to run a scan with a trusted anti-malware utility such as [Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool]( https://www.kaspersky.com/downloads/free-virus-removal-tool), [Hitman Pro](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/hitmanpro/), and [TDSSKiller](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/tdsskiller/). These are both portable applications with no installation for just a scan. Both are simple and easy to use, just follow the onscreen prompts and get start a scan. Once complete if any threats are detected make sure to remove them. You can also if you wish, install a full product to get active protection as well. [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/free-antivirus) and [BitDefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html) are both highly recommended for their free protection.

### Step 2: Recovery
Now that you completed step one its time to figure out what damage the malware caused and remedy it, depending on the malware the this may go from none at all to losing your files so here is two categories and what damage you may have to fix.

#### Info-Stealers
Info stealers are potentially the most damaging as they steal and harvest files and passwords for your computer. If you have any passwords stored in your browser those would be compromised and potentially some files although usually rare. This means you need to change ALL your account passwords ASAP. The longer you wait the more of a chance for your accounts to get locked or stolen so act quickly.

#### Ransomware
Again, potentially one of the most damaging malware types as this one encrypts all your files and makes you pay usually with crypto currency, to get the encryption key back. The algorithms used to encrypt your files are also usually very strong meaning your files are essentially destroyed after being encrypted unless you have the key which would have been moved onto the attackers’ servers and destroyed locally. The best thing you can do is to not turn the computer off if possible and disconnect it from the internet and any storage devices. Some ransomwares can be defeated if you don’t turn off the computer so for the time it’s a good idea not to do that until you know more about the ransomware. If you need to identify the ransomware you are infected by you can upload some information such as the ransom note, an encrypted file or any email addresses given by the readme files on [ID Ransomware](https://id-ransomware.malwarehunterteam.com/). Also if you want more professional advice see this video by  [The PC Security Channel](https://youtu.be/g0yXmQx89x4) from 2019 but still something to keep in mind.

### A quick note
The only way to be truly sure that your computer is no longer infected is to fully reinstall the operating system from a bootable instance. If you are infected by something such as ransomware or an info stealer it is highly suggested after removing the immediate threat and taking immediate recovery steps to reinstall your operating system to ensure that you are safe. Make sure you backup everything important before you complete this step if needed.

## Prevention
Prevention is better than recovery, so here are some steps to go over to protect yourself from a malware infection.

### Don’t run known applications (executable files)
The easiest way to infect yourself is running something you are unsure where it came from. If you are unsure if a file is safe to run or never wanted it in the first place just remove it. If you are unsure if an application is safe, then check out VirusTotal or Hybrid Analysis. These are tools that you can upload applications or files to, and they will check if it’s safe. Note that these are not perfect, but they give a good indication if something may be lurking inside.

### Don’t click on strange links
Links are shared everywhere, but they can also contain links to infected files or phishing scams that try to steal your information so be careful and read the domain carefully. If you did not expect it, then don’t react and use common sense. If your friends usually never bought a package and get a message saying one was not delivered and to click the link, just go to the website yourself.

### Run an Anti-Malware solution
An extra eye is always good, even just default Windows Defender is better than nothing. But a third-party product is usually recommended due to their more advanced detection methods.

### Don’t pirate software
That free price tag may be tempting but don’t fall for it! Lots of pirated software have been modified and replaced with ransomware or other malware. It’s only a matter of time before you get a bad download or torrent and end up infected. So be careful.

### Stay informed
You are the most important part of your security and protection online so stay informed and keep watch in the news or other media sources about security advice or about the latest infection going around and how to protect yourself.
